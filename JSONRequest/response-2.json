(My dough was a little too dry so I added another tablespoon of milk, you may not need it though.)Cover and chill dough for 30 minute or until firm enough to handle. Meanwhile, fit a pastry bag with an injector tip** and fill bag with the salted caramel.When chilled, form dough into 1 inch balls and arrange them on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Carefully push the angled part of the injector tip into each dough-ball and fill it with caramel. You will see the dough swell up a bit as it you fill it. As you're removing the pastry bag, turn it to an angle so the caramel doesn't spill out too much. Repeat with all the truffles. Pop tray of caramel-filled truffles into the freezer for at least an hour so the caramel firms up. (If you need to smooth/clean up the tops from caramel drips, now is the time.)Place the chocolate chips in a heatproof bowl and melt according to instructions on the bag. (One minute on high followed by a stir and 15 second additional intervals works best for me.) Using a spoon or fork, dip truffles into the melted chocolate one and a time, coating evenly. Tap the spoon on the edge of the bowl to shake of excess chocolate. Place truffles back on the baking sheets and sprinkle with sea salt and chocolate curls before the shell hardens.In an airtight container, the truffles will last in the fridge for up to a week.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"In a large bowl beat the butter, peanut butter, and sugars with an electric mixer on medium speed until light and fluffy, 2-3 minutes.","ingredients":[{"id":16098,"name":"peanut butter","image":"peanut-butter.png"}],"equipment":[{"id":404628,"name":"hand mixer","image":"hand-mixer.png"},{"id":404783,"name":"bowl","image":"bowl.jpg"}],"length":{"number":3,"unit":"minutes"}},{"number":2,"step":"Mix in 2 tablespoons milk and vanilla.

the oven to 350 degrees F.                          Set a large Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Add a 3-count of olive oil and gently brown the meatballs. Meanwhile, with a mortar and pestle, grind the salt, black peppercorns and fennel seeds with some olive oil into a grainy paste. Rub the ribs and shoulder with the mixture.                          Remove the meatballs with a slotted spoon and set aside on a paper towel-lined plate to drain. In the same pot, brown the shoulder pieces and ribs, in batches. Alternately to save time, roast the ribs in a preheated 500 degree F oven for 10 to 15 minutes while you brown the shoulder pieces in the pot.                          Remove the shoulder pieces and ribs to the meatball plate and let rest.                          Add a little more olive oil to the pot and add the thyme, oregano, carrots, onion and celery. Stir it around and scrape up the bits from the bottom of the pot with a wooden spoon. Cook the vegetables until they are slightly softened and have some nice color. Add the wine, tomatoes and tomato paste and mix well, scraping up any brown bits on the bottom. Nestle the pork shoulder pieces back into the middle of the pot then arrange the ribs around the sauce. Finish by placing the meatballs in the gaps (some of the pieces will be sticking out from the sauce but that's perfectly fine as it will roast and caramelize). Use a spoon to baste everything well, cover, then put the pot into the oven and roast until the pork is tender and the meat is just falling off the rib bones, about 1 to 1 1/2 hours.                          For the topping: Combine the chopped raisins, toasted pine nuts and parsley in a small bowl.                          Use a slotted spoon to remove the meatballs and ribs to a large platter. Remove the pork shoulder pieces from the pot and allow to rest for 10 minutes before slicing into bite-size pieces and adding them to the platter. Puree the sauce in a food processor then add it back to the pot and set over medium heat. Reduce the sauce until it is rich and thick, about 5 minutes. Season with salt and pepper, if needed. When the spaghetti is cooked, drain and add to a medium bowl. Spoon a little sauce over the spaghetti and the remaining sauce over the platter of meat. Garnish the meat platter with the raisin mixture and serve.                          Heat 3 tablespoons oil in an ovenproof skillet over medium heat. Add the onion, garlic, and parsley and cook until the vegetables are soft but not colored, about 10 minutes. Take the pan off the heat and let the mixture cool.                          Add the bread to a medium bowl and pour in the milk. Let the bread soak while the onions are cooling. Combine the meats in a large bowl. Add the egg and cheese and season generously with salt and pepper. Use your hands to squeeze the excess milk out of the bread and add it to the bowl along with the cooled onion mixture. Gently combine all the ingredients with your hands until just mixed together. Don't overwork the mixture or the meatballs will be tough. Divide the mixture into 8 equal pieces and shape them into 8 nice looking meatballs. Refrigerate until ready to cook.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Heat the oven to 350 degrees F.","ingredients":[],"equipment":[{"id":404784,"name":"oven","image":"oven.jpg","temperature":{"number":350.0,"unit":"Fahrenheit"}}]},{"number":2,"step":"Set a large Dutch oven over medium-high heat.","ingredients":[],"equipment":[{"id":404667,"name":"dutch oven","image":"dutch-oven.jpg"}]},{"number":3,"step":"Add a 3-count of olive oil and gently brown the meatballs.
